# WasteNet
WasteNet uses AI and cameras to solve waste problem by automatically sorting waste like plastic and cardboard from a live feed. This smart system tracks amount of sorted waste and intelligently calls for the correct recycling truck when needed. This makes waste collection more efficient, reduces costs, and boosts recycling rates for a cleaner city.

**Project WasteNet** is a conceptual project that aims to solve the urban waste management crisis using AI and smart logistics. The project is the brainchild of the **Cyber Souls** team.

This responsive and animated webpage details the problem of urban waste, the proposed solution, and the potential impact of the WasteNet system.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** A visually appealing single-page application with smooth scrolling, animations, and a glassmorphism design.
- **Problem & Solution:** Clearly outlines the problem of urban waste and presents the "WasteNet" solution.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes a Chart.js doughnut chart to visualize waste management statistics.
- **Tabbed Content:** Toggle between "AI Sorting" and "Intelligent Logistics" to see different aspects of the solution.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## The Problem

The project highlights the critical issue of urban waste in cities like Delhi, where a large percentage of waste is unmanaged and unsegregated, leading to pollution and inefficiency.

## The WasteNet Solution

WasteNet is an end-to-end intelligent platform designed to automate waste sorting and streamline collection. It consists of two main components:

1.  **AI Sorting Unit:** Utilizes AI-powered computer vision (YOLOv8) for real-time classification of waste into different streams (e.g., PET, cardboard, organic).
2.  **Intelligent Logistics:** An automated system that uses real-time data from sorting units to trigger on-demand dispatch of collection vehicles when waste thresholds are met.

## Technologies Used

-   **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
-   **Libraries:** Chart.js
-   **Proposed Backend/AI:**
    -   AI Model for object detection
    -   Waste Database for the database
    -   Cloud Functions for logistics logic
